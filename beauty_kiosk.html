                    <h3 style="color: black">The Problem</h3>
                    <p>When it comes to adopting an appropriate skincare routine, it is a common-place occurrence to be devoid of the awareness of one’s skin type. As a result, there is an observed general tendency to experiment with various products, to finally arrive at a product that is better suited to one’s skin. As reported in a market survey conducted by Mintel in October 2015, consumers believe that general factors such as regular facial cleansing, lifestyle changes, sunlight exposure, dietary patterns, and adherence to a daily skin regimen impacted their skin’s appearance greater than visiting a dermatologist. Furthermore, with the rise of social media and influencer culture, people find it easier to follow popular opinions and choose products that have garnered a massive following. These behavioral tendencies to experiment with various products, incorporating lifestyle changes aimed at influencing skin and following popular culture strongly suggests that people want to take control of their skincare journey and find comfort in personalizing it for themselves. However, this is a cause for concern for the following reasons. Firstly, experimenting with various products may do greater damage than good. Further, mere lifestyle changes and regular cleansing does not suffice for skincare and there is a strong need for expert interventions. Lastly, adopting products basis influencers’ suggestions may not necessarily suit one’s individual skin-type.

                    <h3 style="color: black">The Solution</h3>
                    <p>We hereby introduce a skin type self-assessment service station, which is supposed to be located in a Cosmetic shop whereby not only customers have an opportunity to identify their skin type, but they also get recommendations on products that would support their skincare endeavors. At the same time, it upholds their preference to personalize their individualistic skincare journeys.

                    <p>Before diving into any problem, I believe it’s important to <strong>state a problem hypothesis and then test it. </strong>Testing a problem hypothesis allows me to develop a deep understanding of the problem, discover implications, and see if it’s worth solving in the first place.

                    <p class="pb-3">When we developed this hypothesis, we asked ourselves the following:<i>what kind of data do we need to test this hypothesis? Where can we find quick customer feedback data? Where will we find users to validate our ideas?</i>

                    <h5 style="color: black">Reviewing the Reviews</h5>
                    <p>we went to the play store reviews of popular marketplace apps to find out if other users recognized this as a problem.This allowed us to get quick data about users without investing time & energy into recruiting users and interviewing users.<strong> We audited over 200 reviews </strong>and found that many negative reviews mentioned this problem.
