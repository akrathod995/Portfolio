                    <h3 style="color: black">Introduction</h3>
                    <p>The current times that we live in require us to maintain social distancing and function remotely. Work, school and social life has been changed. With a rise in the prevalence of digital communication came its use as the main form of social interaction. Feelings of isolation and loneliness cancome with digital communication. Often, the feeling ofloneliness may go unnoticed by others and at times, we maynot realise it ourselves.There exists various projects that can help determine aperson's mood, but none that can determine a person'sloneliness quotient. Therefore, we introduce a device to aim and measure the level of a person's loneliness.This self-awareness will enable people to introduce preventive measures at an individual level to avoidadvanced stages of depression, anxiety and allied issues that may result from the condition of being lonely. The device ascertains the extent of social interaction that they are involved in analysing the frequency of communication between the sender and the receiver and thereby determines the extent of loneliness. This device is composed of an Arduino board (acts as communication media for interaction), LED light (its amount of brightness indicates the level of loneliness), servo motor (for engagement and visual appeal) and jumper wires. The softwares implemented are Arduino, processing and MQTT.

                    <h3 style="color: black">Academic Research</h3>
                    <p>Our research came from a reflection on the rise of digital communication as a form of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly when one traditional social support, physical contact, has been identified as something to be avoided in order to stop the spread of the virus. This has been called the “COVID-19 Social Connectivity Paradox” and has been seen as a key problem to be solved when battling social isolation during the pandemic, especially older adults. The use of digital technology offers a mechanism for greater social inclusion in older adults. It also brings with it a danger of disempowerment, as users without the appropriate skills to engage with it or tackle the fear surrounding it see a furthering of a digital divide that causes reduced access to the ever-growing section of society that resides exclusively online.The widening of this digital divide is also likely to increase social isolation. The link between social isolation and digital technology is not exclusive to older adults. Studies of social media use in young adults show that it is strongly associated with social isolation and how a reduction in use can decrease depression and loneliness. Evidently,the way that people interact with digital technology can have an effect on their emotions and feelings of connection to others. This feeling of disconnection from others or aperception of social isolation are key factors when investigating loneliness, the main focus of this project. When a person’s social and intimate needs are not met a feeling of loneliness occurs that serves as an alarm to notify them to seek fulfillment of these needs. Loneliness scales have been developed that aim to measure the levels of loneliness a person feels. Examples like the UCLA scale that have been proven to be effective and are based on a questionnaire format that uses a points-based system to measure this loneliness. In a contemporary digital settingsocial media has been used as a measurement tool for depression in populations.The use of social media as a measurement tool for a feeling of depression that can be linked with social media use can be related to the feelings of disempowerment and social isolation that occurs in older users who are unable to utilise digital technology as a social support. Both examples show groups of users who can see the social benefits of the use of digital communication technology but in attempting to do so have ended up feeling more isolated. This idea that digital communication, a tool used by many as a form of social support, can cause increased feelings of loneliness is what caused this project to develop in the way it did. The project developed as a way to measure and explore the relationship between digital communication and loneliness.

                        <p>Our research revealed a couple of solutions that help determine a person's mood, but not the level of loneliness.These include the following - 'I'm Fine'; a project that monitors the wellbeing of the elderly people who are devoid of daily contact with family and other people. 'The Mood Lamp project', a system that uses interactions to communicate one's emotional state using facial expressions to a physical object and receive back a coherent response.

                    <h3 style="color: black">Development</h3>
                    <p>This project was developed iteratively. Each element of the project was built, tested and improved with each iteration.In order to make sure each part of the system operated correctly this was done in parts, focusing on input, output,data management and communication. Each will be discussed here.</p>
                    <h5 style="color: black">Input</h5>
                    <p>Initially, the input for this system began as buttons. The buttons were used to test the loneliness score code. Button presses were used to create random numbers that were then sent to a loneliness function. If the number sent to the function was within a threshold set (e.g below 7 in a number range 0-10) the message would be received and the loneliness score would be adjusted to signify less loneliness. If the received number was outside the threshold the loneliness score would be adjusted to signify more loneliness. This loneliness score was then used to affect the output.As the MQTT communication became functional, periodic messages replaced the button input. Each arduino created random numbers at regular intervals and sent them over MQTT to the other arduino to be judged in the way described above. The buttons were kept to facilitate testing.</p>
                    <h5 style="color: black">Output</h5>
                    <p>The output for the project started as LEDs that reacted to the button presses. Using the loneliness score that changed as described in the input section determined the brightness of the LED. Flashing, dimming and on/off lighting of the LED was used in these initial test stages. The LED output was kept in the project to show input being received and to signify if the message received had been read or not. One arduino, the sender, kept only an LED as an output. The receiver arduino added another input, a servo motor that turned dependent on the loneliness score. This servo motor was connected to a hand built from cardboard using string and a pulley system. The loneliness score changed the angle of the servo and as the servo motor moved the cardboard hand opened and closed.</p>
                    <h5 style="color: black">Data Management</h5>
                    <p>The way data was monitored starting out was by using the Arduino serial monitor. This data consisted of random numbers that were created by button presses and then sent to a loneliness function to adjust the loneliness score. As the MQTT communication was enabled, the serial monitor was unavailable to be used. This is partly the reason why the button and LEDs were kept in the project. Although the Processing sketch used enabled monitoring of messages coming in, a physical element to the sending and receiving of messages was useful to monitor the flow of information as it moved from one Arduino board to the other.</p>
                    <h5 style="color: black">Communication</h5>
                        <p>MQTT communication was used in this project to send and receive messages between two Arduinos. The code provided to us by the module lead was used to develop initial communication. The processing sketch was not altered greatly and the Arduino code was used to test initial communication and then our own was developed. A MQTT broker was set up on shiftr.io and connected to using the Processing sketch. Initially the messages sent via Serial from Arduino to Processing were published to a broker that shared the same name with the broker the Processing sketch was subscribed to. This allowed us to test if the messages sent from Arduino were making their way back. Once this was functional each Arduino published messages to their own namespace and the other Arduino subscribed to it, allowing messages to be sent to one another remotely

                    <h5 style="color: black">Sender</h5>
                    <p>The sender arduino is the arduino with the button and the LED. Initializing the system with the press of a button , generates a random number that is sent to the receivers end of the arduino via the MQTT server as a series of messages. A threshold number of 8 was set for messages, which meant any message below 8 made the LED bright which in terms of the concept is feeling less lonely. If the value is greater than 8 , the messages are missed and the LED would fade out and the loneliness score is calculated accordingly.

                    <h5 style="color: black">Receiver</h5>
                    <p>The receiver arduino was the Arduino with the servo motor output. This system received messages that were sent from the other Arduino and used them to adjust their loneliness score. As discussed in the description of the input, a threshold for messages was set. In this case the threshold was set to 7, meaning any messages below 7 made the system less lonely and any above 7 made the system more lonely. If the message received was below 7, the LED would fade in and out, showing a message was received. If it was above 7, the light would blink to show the message was not understood. The loneliness score was sent to a function that moved the servo motor and the hand each time a message was received. A random number message was also sent to the sender system regularly.

                    <h5 style="color: black">Results</h5>
                    <p>The device was tested to evaluate its functioning. It successfully yielded a result i.e. calculation of loneliness signified by glowing of the light bulb - during 5 out of 7 such attempts. Further, the number of times the random function generated a continuous input of numbers 1-8 were significantly higher than the number of times it generated numbers higher than 8 (70:30 ratio). When the finished project was left to its own devices to communicate using regular messages, the results were more interesting than when the buttons were used. The LEDs would light up and the hand would open/close without any human interaction. Sometimes the hand would show periods where the system became extremely lonely and it would close up quite quickly, only for messages to be received that would open the hand back up. In this sense, the hand provided a poignant physical representation of the human side of digital communication. It showed how an inability to receive messages and social support causes one to close up and how receiving messages allows you to open back up. The difficulties of creating this physical representation of loneliness meant that the hand was not as explicit in its opening and closing. It required a lot of calibration andtesting to get functioning suitably, and perhaps with access to better materials and components a better physical representation could be made.

                    <h3 style="color: black">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>The finished project aimed to explore the area of digital communication and loneliness. Through the use of Arduino, Processing and MQTT it was possible to build a system that took inputs, sent messages to another remote system and used messages received to produce outputs. The physical representation of the ‘user’ at the end of a digital communication system was the cardboard hand. While it was functional in responding to the changes in loneliness as a result of incoming messages it lacked in its ability to explicitly demonstrate loneliness. The movement was subtle and didn’t show loneliness as wished. Despite acknowledging where this project failed it is also clear there are aspects of this project that could develop further. The physical, human-like representation of loneliness at the end of a digital communication chain is an interesting idea that would be justified in pursuing further. Should this project develop further, the goal would be to build two separate systems with physical representations of loneliness and have them placed in separate locations to be left in constant communication. This longer form art installation would allow for longer time between messages and a more gradual development into or out of loneliness.
