            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>The assortment and disposal of solid refuse has been a problem in Sri lanka for many decades. The common modes of disposal include burning and disposing garbage in assortment yards. If this pressing situation is not addressed in a timely manner, these issues are likely to snowball with catastrophic consequences. These such as poor health and quality of life, reduction in life expectancy and further imposes pressure on public health services. It is essential to impart awareness and knowledge about waste disposal at a young age to inculcate behavioural transformation.</p>
					
		    
            <div class="lgspace"></div>

            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p>Sweep City is a mobile application, designed to support the Waste Disposal Awareness Campaign conducted by the Government of  Sri Lanka. The application is aimed at sensitising young learners on waste management in a game format that entices them and brings about an attitudinal transition in their approach towards waste management. It also contains an informational repository that engages learners with educational content on waste management.
            </p>
					<ul>
              <li>
                The game is designed around the concept of segregating waste into appropriate trash-cans as that can be easily grasped by young learners. 
              </li>
              <li>
               The game will present a series of hurdles to add difficulty to progress towards higher levels 
              </li>
              <li>
              Users will receive in-game rewards/points for hitting the right bins. The rewards can be redeemed by users to beautify a virtual area.
              </li>
                <li>
              The app also contains an infotainment repository of engaging content on waste management techniques and upcycling tutorials
              </li>
              
            </ul>

            <h3>Forming a Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>Before diving into any problem, I believe it’s important to <strong>state a problem hypothesis and 
              then test it. </strong>Testing a problem hypothesis allows me to develop a deep understanding of the 
              problem, discover implications, and see if it’s worth solving in the first place.
            </p>
            <div class="smspace"></div>

            <div class="important">
              <h6 class="important-heading-bold">My Hypothesis</h6>
              <p>Users feel frustated by the search results for bikes in marketplace apps. Having
                an exclusive app for bikes with filters to find the exact type of bike solves the problem.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lgspace"></div>
-->

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            
                    <p class="pb-3">The campaign in Sri Lanka is mainly targeted at young students as the primary target audience. In order to probe deeper into the waste-generating patterns among the student community, primary research was conducted with students based in Limerick.</p>
                    <div class="row justify-content-center">
              <img src="images/UserResearch.PNG">
            </div>
                    <p>The objective of the research was to assess the following:</p>
                    <ul>
              <li>
                Waste generation patterns and habits 
              </li>
              <li>
               Extent of current awareness about waste management and recycling techniques. 
              </li>
              <li>
               Level of awareness among respondents regarding not-for-profit organizations that mobilize waste.
              </li>
              
            </ul>
      

           <h5>Findings from Survey</h5>
            <p>In order to reach more people and gather more diverse feedback, a survey was conducted. The findings and analysis are listed below
            </p>
            <div class="smspace"></div>
                    <div class="row justify-content-center">

            </div>
                    
            <h5>Findings from Interviews</h5>
            <p>In addition to the research, interviews were conducted among students to ascertain whether education on waste management and recycling techniques was included in their curriculum. This would indicate whether the schools and institutions regard any importance to these activities in school. Most respondents expressed denial. This further unveiled the need for imparting such awareness at the grassroot level i.e., childhood, the primitive stages of one’s early life.
            </p>
                    
                    
            <h5>SWOT Analysis</h5>  
                    <p>In order to examine the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the gaming initiative, I conducted a SWOT analysis that would guide the conception of the mobile application:

              thoughts and feelings of the users.

					<h3>Sketching & Wireframing</h3>
            <p>Early ideas  were sketched out repeatedly with pen and paper in order 
              to form a general idea of the possible screens and user flows. The lightning-fast nature of these

					 <h3>Testing & Iterating</h3>
            <p>The prototypes were tested for usability with users through cognitve walk-throughs. Basis user's feedback the screens were mocked up  to build prototype in Adobe XD.

              The hierarchy was remodelled for simplification for ease of consumption and discovery of content by the end users. To learn what is important to the success of the product and be able to address the needs of the user by providing them access to only important information and serve in the best way possible.

            <h3>Exploring Ideas</h3>
            <p>Based on my research, I feel confident that there is a recognizable amount of frustration in 
              marketplace app users searching for bikes. If we solve this problem, users will be able to find the right 
              bike quickly without searching through unwanted search results. I also went through multiple revisions of 
              different "How Might We" questions to help to me have a clear understanding of the problem I was solving.

            <p>Anyone can come up with an idea and think to themselves <i>"this idea is great, now let's move

              When I break the idea down and question it's value, I can often find small issues that need to be 
              addressed. Here are a few of those 'Things to consider:'</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                How to filter and show bikes efficiently?

                What are the important information buyers want to know about the bikes?

                How to connect buyers and sellers while maintaining privacy?
